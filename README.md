# Project description

Using the [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00242/ENB2012_data.xlsx)'s energy efficiency dataset provided on the Hamoye Data Science Summer Internship, 2022, I created a Simple Linear Regression Model and a Multiple Linear Regression model to predict cooling and heating loads respectively, in buildings.
